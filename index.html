        <p>
          Hello my name is Kevin Anderson and I am a fullstack developer. I currently live Lewisville Texas. I am just getting into the programming scene
          trying to start my career. I am a graduate of the Southern Methodist University Full stack developmet program. I have passion for learning and improving
          my skills. The reason I chose to program is because for as long as I can remember, my dad has always showed so much passion for what he does being a computer 
          programmer and I look up to him so much. He has really made me fall in love with the idea of programming. I have a few projects under my belt as a developer, 
          some of them have been group projects which has really taught me how to work in a team enviroment. I have also worked on a few personal side projects as well.
          Some of my hobbies include golfing, working out, and playing video games. I am currently looking for a job in the field of software development and am really open to
          a lot of different positions.
        </p>
